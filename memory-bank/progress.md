# Progress: Child's First App (Animal Sounds)

## What Works
- Basic Next.js application structure is in place
- Initial component architecture has been defined
- Styling system using Tailwind CSS is configured
- Simple routing between pages is functional
- Project structure follows modern Next.js practices
- Development environment is set up with appropriate tooling

## What's In Progress
- Animal grid component implementation
- Category navigation system
- Sound playback system
- Animation system for interactive elements
- Responsive design for various device sizes
- Asset collection (animal images and sounds)

## What's Left to Build
- Complete set of animal categories and content
- Detailed animal information displays
- Interactive animations on animal selection
- Sound effect quality improvements
- Category selection interface
- Visual feedback systems
- Potential mini-games or activities
- Integration with unified platform
- Parent/teacher controls and settings
- Progress tracking (if applicable)

## Current Status
The Animal Sounds app is in early development with the basic structure in place. The framework and architecture have been established, but most of the content and interactive elements still need to be implemented. 

### Priority Focus Areas
1. Complete the core animal grid functionality
2. Implement sound playback system
3. Add initial set of animals with images and sounds
4. Create basic category navigation

## Known Issues
- No persistent state management implemented yet
- Sound loading and playback optimization needed
- Asset collection incomplete (placeholder images/sounds)
- UI components need refinement for child users
- Testing with actual users not yet conducted

## Success Criteria Status

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Animal recognition | Not tested | Core functionality in development |
| Independent engagement | Not tested | Basic UI in progress |
| Intuitive interface | In development | Initial designs created |
| Delightful experience | Planned | Animation system in early stages |
