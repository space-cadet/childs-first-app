# System Patterns: Child's First App (Animal Sounds)

## Architecture Overview

The Animal Sounds app follows a simple, component-based architecture designed for clarity and maintainability. It's built using Next.js with TypeScript and emphasizes client-side interactions with minimal server requirements.

## Key Components

### 1. Main Interface
- **Animal Grid**: Displays a collection of interactive animal tiles
- **Category Navigation**: Allows switching between animal categories (farm, wild, pets, etc.)
- **Audio Controller**: Manages sound playback with appropriate timing

### 2. Animal Components
- **Animal Tile**: Clickable/tappable component with animal image
- **Animation Controller**: Manages subtle animations for engagement
- **Sound Trigger**: Connects user interaction to sound playback

### 3. Navigation System
- **Simple Menu**: Large, icon-based navigation suitable for young children
- **Breadcrumbs**: Visual indication of current location in the app

## Data Management

### Animal Data Structure
```typescript
interface Animal {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  displayName?: string; // Simplified name for children
  category: AnimalCategory;
  imagePath: string;
  soundPath: string;
  funFact?: string; // Optional educational content
}

type AnimalCategory = 'farm' | 'wild' | 'pets' | 'ocean' | 'jungle';
```

### State Management
- React's useState and useContext for local and shared state
- Minimal global state requirements
- Preference for props over complex state management

## Interaction Patterns

### User Interactions
- Large touch targets for developing motor skills
- Immediate audio-visual feedback on interaction
- Simple tap/click as primary interaction method
- Optional swipe for category navigation

### Feedback Mechanisms
- Visual highlighting of selected animals
- Audio playback of animal sounds
- Subtle animations to indicate interactivity
- Optional celebration animations for engagement

## Technical Decisions

### Front-end Technologies
- Next.js for application framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations

### Media Handling
- Optimized images for fast loading
- Preloaded audio files for immediate playback
- Responsive design for various device sizes

## Integration Points

### Unified Platform Integration
- Shared authentication context
- Common UI components and theme
- Standard navigation patterns
- Progress tracking integration

## Testing Approach
- Component testing with Jest
- User testing with the target age group
- Accessibility testing for inclusive design
- Performance testing for various devices
