# Active Context: Child's First App (Animal Sounds)

## Current Focus
The Animal Sounds app is currently being prepared for integration into the Sayu Unified Platform. The main focus is on preserving the core functionality while adapting the UI and state management to work seamlessly within the unified experience.

## Recent Changes
- Initial setup of the Next.js application structure
- Implementation of basic animal grid layout
- Creation of reusable animal component
- Addition of initial set of animal images and sounds
- Implementation of basic category navigation
- Setup of sound playback system

## Active Decisions

### Integration Approach
- Maintain core functionality while adapting to unified platform design
- Use shared UI components where appropriate
- Keep animal-specific logic encapsulated for maintainability
- Ensure smooth navigation between this app and other modules

### UI/UX Decisions
- Large, clear animal images for easy recognition
- Simple tap/click interaction model
- Subtle animations for positive feedback
- Clear categorization of animals (farm, wild, etc.)
- Audio quality prioritized for learning value

### Technical Decisions
- Audio preloading for immediate playback
- Optimized images for performance
- Modular component design for reusability
- Client-side interactions for responsiveness

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Complete the basic animal grid implementation
2. Add remaining animal assets (images and sounds)
3. Implement category navigation
4. Add sound effects and animations
5. Create responsive layout for different devices
6. Test with target age group

### Integration Tasks
1. Adapt UI to unified platform design system
2. Implement shared navigation components
3. Connect to shared user context if applicable
4. Ensure consistent styling with other modules

## Current Considerations
- Balancing simplicity for young users with feature richness
- Ensuring optimal performance on various devices
- Creating intuitive navigation suitable for pre-readers
- Maintaining educational value while being entertaining
- Planning for integration with other learning modules
